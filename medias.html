           I've been working on this one for a while-- but it was all thanks to the wonderful people at the Community Data Science Collective for supporting me throughout my first serious research endeavor. It'd be a mistake to believe we could ever fully 
      explain human interactions. The Internet just makes that even weirder. I started wondering about the "haters" and how people sometimes are really proud to be 'decorated, five-star haters." After reading the robust work already trying to map our online communities, and 
      discussions with Sohyeon Hwang, Nate TeBlunthuis, and Aaron Shaw, it turns out we haven't really taken the haters seriously yet. </div>
