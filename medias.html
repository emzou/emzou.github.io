          <div class = "text" > i loved this so so so much. i think all the haters are wrong. we usually think of love-- and the subsequent love stories-- as the thing
            between two people. but love also alters the individual, one of the fundamental forces of human nature, shaping who you, without your object of desire, are. 
            i cannot recommend this enough. </div>
