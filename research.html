         <div class = "text" > When people talk about politics online, their conversations are not necessarily intentionally and/or solely political in content. 
           Take, for instance, a college application advice forum that opens discussion on affirmative action policies, or a group of fans comparing the 
           events of a fantasy show to a real-world political conflict. 
           This subtler level of political engagement is produced through the platforms it takes place on; 
           there is no way to separate the 'political' content from the 'non-political' content within these discussions. 
           Then, as online platforms and digital social networks develop, they give rise to new and unfamiliar modes of political
           communication. The means to identify what online political communication is– and what it is not– must evolve also: 
           measures to combat issues of online misinformation, polarization, and media literacy will not be effective if based on 
           an unrepresentative and unrealistic understanding of online human behavior. In order to understand how digital platforms 
           alter online political communication, I use computational grounded theory to ask: 1] How do features of online communities shape the content, process, and
           outcomes of political communication? 2] How have online communities enabled new ways to do political communication?  </div>

           I've been working on this one for a while-- but it was all thanks to the wonderful people at the Community Data Science Collective for supporting me throughout my first serious research endeavor. It'd be a mistake to believe we could ever fully 
      explain human interactions. The Internet just makes that even weirder. I started wondering about the "haters" and how people sometimes are really proud to be 'decorated, five-star haters." After reading the robust work already trying to map our online communities, and 
      discussions with Sohyeon Hwang, Nate TeBlunthuis, and Aaron Shaw, it turns out we haven't really taken the haters seriously yet. </div>
