      <div class = "turretout"> Upcoming Senior Thesis project on how notions of justice and morality manifest in online communities  </div>
         <div class = "text" > Based observations of the r/justiceserved community, I ask: "1] Does this socially-intuited form of justice hold any moral weight? Does it override or capitulate to other figurations of justice? 
2] Can a society erroneously determine "justness"? If it can, what authority supersedes the moral judgements of the masses? (And should it?) 
3] What is the unique utility of felt justice? What are its existing and potential harms? 
4] Does justice exist before it is observed? (If a tree falls on a tyrant in the middle of a forest, but there's no one around to post about it on social media, is it still justice?)

      <div class = "turretout"> Characterizing the moral weight of rule and punishment in online communities  </div>
         <div class = "text" > I am hoping to take a mixed-methods approach across philosophy and social computing to understand
           the (often inconsistent, and certainly understudied) judicial processes that occur within online communities. Particularly, I am interested
           in whether moderators of online communities attach any moral baggage in their rule enforcement. I also hope to show how empirical patterns in 
           online communities can inform/challenge prevailing discourses in philosophy about retribution, justice, and punishment.
