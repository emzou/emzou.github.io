                <p>I'm a first-year PhD student in Stanford's Communication department, where I'm advised by Dr. Jennifer Pan. I'm interested in how people 
                    learn and talk about politics online. I investigate this through natural language processing and computational social science 
                    broadly. Before, I was an undergraduate in Northwestern's American Studies program. I graduated in 2024.</p>

                <p>Above all, I am driven by an earnest, naive love for humanity, please reach out to talk about anything. I'm currently thinking a lot about 
                    attempts to create 'America' in film, how the experience of video games is fundamentally a religious one, and what the One Piece is.
