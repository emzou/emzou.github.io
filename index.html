                    <p>I'm a first-year PhD student in Stanford's Communication department, where I'm advised by Dr. Jennifer Pan. I'm interested in how people 
                        learn and talk about politics online. I investigate this through natural language processing and computational social science 
                        broadly. Before, I was an undergraduate in Northwestern's American Studies program. I graduated in 2024.</p>

                    <p> I just got here, and I'm working to actually have things on here soon. I'll probably be researching and writing about online communities, how I don't think there's a distinction between
                        politics and non-politics, classifying 'political' text in NLP pipelines, and describing circuits of information.</p>

                    <p> I am a optimistic humanist who is often cranky. I am also earnesty-pilled and love talking to people. Please reach out to talk about research, books/movies, 
                        do armchair sociology on content creators, etc...
