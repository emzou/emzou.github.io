         specific category. Above all, she loves people and listening to how they think about the world.

2] Can a society erroneously determine "justness"? If it can, what authority supersedes the moral judgements of the masses? (And should it?) 
3] What is the unique utility of felt justice? What are its existing and potential harms? 
4] Does justice exist before it is observed? (If a tree falls on a tyrant in the middle of a forest, but there's no one around to post about it on social media, is it still justice?)

         <div class = "text" > I am hoping to take a mixed-methods approach across philosophy and social computing to understand
           the (often inconsistent, and certainly understudied) judicial processes that occur within online communities. Particularly, I am interested
           in whether moderators of online communities attach any moral baggage in their rule enforcement. I also hope to show how empirical patterns in 
           online communities can inform/challenge prevailing discourses in philosophy about retribution, justice, and punishment.

      discussions with Sohyeon Hwang, Nate TeBlunthuis, and Aaron Shaw, it turns out we haven't really taken the haters seriously yet. </div>

      you’d never guess the role that William Nierenberg, who served as director of Scripps for 21 years, 
      played in obfuscating climate change in the public eye. </div>
