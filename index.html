2] Can a society erroneously determine "justness"? If it can, what authority supersedes the moral judgements of the masses? (And should it?) 
3] What is the unique utility of felt justice? What are its existing and potential harms? 
4] Does justice exist before it is observed? (If a tree falls on a tyrant in the middle of a forest, but there's no one around to post about it on social media, is it still justice?)

         <div class = "text" > I am hoping to take a mixed-methods approach across philosophy and social computing to understand
           the (often inconsistent, and certainly understudied) judicial processes that occur within online communities. Particularly, I am interested
           in whether moderators of online communities attach any moral baggage in their rule enforcement. I also hope to show how empirical patterns in 
           online communities can inform/challenge prevailing discourses in philosophy about retribution, justice, and punishment.

           I've been working on this one for a while-- but it was all thanks to the wonderful people at the Community Data Science Collective for supporting me throughout my first serious research endeavor. It'd be a mistake to believe we could ever fully 
      explain human interactions. The Internet just makes that even weirder. I started wondering about the "haters" and how people sometimes are really proud to be 'decorated, five-star haters." After reading the robust work already trying to map our online communities, and 
      discussions with Sohyeon Hwang, Nate TeBlunthuis, and Aaron Shaw, it turns out we haven't really taken the haters seriously yet. </div>
