         <div class = "text" > I am currently serving as the lab coordinator for a  <a href= "https://ccl.northwestern.edu" >computer science research lab  </a>  at Northwestern: 
           this means I'm updating the lab's website through github, coordinating staff meetings, copyediting manuscripts, managing mailing lists, checking 
           citations and references, and anything else it takes to keep the place running smoothly. I also rewrote the code for our staff and alumni page, and am 
         currently building a data visualization for the thousands of global contributions to NetLogo! I mostly recently assisted in a scoping review on the usage of computational models in education.  </div>
